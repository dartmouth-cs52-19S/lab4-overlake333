# lab4-overlake333

I created Create + Update + Delete (CRUD) style recipe library app that using React and Redux and React-Router. Once someone creates a new recipe, the data is hosted in the cs52-blog.herokuapp.com API server. Users can add, delete, and modify a list of all recipes. Each modification page has its own route as well. 

### What worked
Taking the time to understand the diagrams and powerpoint before diving in. Already knowing React, it was much easier to implement redux and react-routers.

### What didn't work
I would like to learn more about the API server we are using to store the data and somehow my master branch on github had been deleted which made turning this lab in a bit more difficult that usual.

### Extra Credit
1) I tried to make a different CRUD concept than a simple blog post
2) I added an alert to tell the user that not all of the fields (in creating a new recipe) have been filled out.
